PyBank and PyPoll Challenges


In this project, we are tasked with analyzing two different datasets using Python scripts: PyBank and PyPoll. The PyBank dataset contains financial records for a company, including the date and the profit/loss for each month. The PyPoll dataset contains voting data for a small, rural town, including the voter ID, county, and candidate voted for.

For each dataset, we are required to calculate specific values and display them in the terminal, as well as export a text file with the results. The specific requirements for each dataset are as follows:


PyBank Requirements

Read in the CSV file using Python
Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset
Calculate the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
Calculate the changes in profit/losses over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
Find the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Find the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Print the results to the terminal in a specific format
Export a text file with the results


PyPoll Requirements

Read in the CSV file using Python
Calculate the total number of votes cast
Create a list of all the candidates who received votes
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won
Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
Print the results to the terminal in a specific format
Export a text file with the results


PyBank Output

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)


PyPoll Output

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (221823)
Correy: 20.000% (70400)
Li: 14.000% (49294)
O'Tooley: 3.000% (10537)
-------------------------
Winner: Khan

Additionally, a text file (PyBankResults.txt or PyPollResults.txt) will be created in the same directory as the Python scripts, containing the same results as the terminal output.

Conclusion

In this project, we learned how to read CSV files using Python, calculate specific values from the data, and export the results to a text file. By completing the PyBank and PyPoll challenges, we gained valuable experience with data analysis
